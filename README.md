# MUSA 800 Project: Bus Ridership Prediction in Austin, Texas

# Project Team:

* Hanyong Xu
* Jia Yuan
* Yibing Zheng

# Use Case:

The use case of this project is to help planners to test how changes of built environment and/or route features impact bus ridership in Austin. More specificly, our intention is to provide a scenario planning tool so that planners can gain a better understanding on ridership change and streamline future bus system design process.
